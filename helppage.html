<h2 style="color:navy">How do I use the store page?</h2>
<font>If you need to use the storepage, you can one of the premade weapons that will arrive at a cheaper, preset cost. To do this, find the item you want and select it's checkbox. Then scroll to the bottom of the screen, where you can fill out a short form so that the item may be shipped to you when it's completed.</font>
<h2 style="color:navy">How do I use the custom store page?</h2>
<font>The custom storepage allows you to select an item for us to enhance, with up to five enhancements! Please note that this will come at a heightened cost and construction time, as the item is being made from scratch. To further customize, you may use the Canvas to create your weapon digitally, in a style that we will attempt to follow.</font>
