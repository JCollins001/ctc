<h2 style="color:navy">What is Medieval Reborn?</h2>
<font>Medieval Reborn is a site of bladesmiths, engineers, technicians, and reseachers set on bringing medieval combat into our modern age by relying on advanced technology, pyrotechnics, and the skill of it's user. While not set for war, they work as fine, if not better than traditional blades, while also retaining the additions added by our specialists.</font>
<h2 style="color:navy">Who is in charge?</h2>
<font>The company is co-owned, though consists of numerous employees who work to keep it in the place it is. Owned by Jack Collins and Jacob Wisialowski, who came up with a shared idea and saw it through into what it's become now.</font>
<h2 style="color:navy">What kind of services are provided?</h2>
<font>We create numerous kinds of medieval weaponry, from jousts to crossbows, that are historically accurate or remakes of post designs using modern science. Once the blade is crafted, it will be passed onto engineers and technicians who give it the spark of life that Medieval Reborn strives to give, adding different technological devices to increase it's uses from just a blade, or to further improve on that.</font><br><br>
